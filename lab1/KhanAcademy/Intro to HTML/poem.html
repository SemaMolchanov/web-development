    <h1>Don't sit down 'cause I moved your chair</h1>
    <p>Break a mirror, roll the dice <br>
    Run with scissors through a chip pan fire fight <br>
    Go into business with a grizzly bear <br>
    But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair <br>
        <br>
    Find a well-known hard man and start a fight <br>
    Wear your shell suit on bonfire night <br>
    Fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square <br>
    But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair <br>
        <br>
    Bite the lightning and tell me how it tastes <br>
    Kung fu fighting on your roller skates <br>
    Do the Macarena in the devil's lair <br>
    But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair <br></p>
